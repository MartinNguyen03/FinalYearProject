Your task is to generate a Behaviour Tree (BT) that achieves the given task by calling the appropriate action nodes with fully specified arguments. Each action node must have clearly defined `action`, `rope`, `marker`, and `site` arguments.

The BT must use the following actions as node names:
- pick_up
- place
- check_goal
- check_visual

Each node must be formatted as:
<ActionNode action="..." rope="..." marker="..." site="..." />

Ensure that the tree follows logical sequencing (using `Sequence` and `Fallback` nodes as appropriate) and includes any necessary checks or fallbacks.

The BT should:
1. Respect the current location of each rope and marker as provided.
2. Ensure ropes are placed in their correct target or placeholder locations.
3. Use checks (e.g., `check_goal` or `check_visual`) where needed to verify success.
4. Include fallbacks for potential failure (e.g., if a `pick_up` fails, retry or log via a `description` field).

Use concise and well-structured formatting. Only output the raw XML-formatted BT.
