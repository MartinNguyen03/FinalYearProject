You are controlling a bi-manual robot tasked with manipulating ropes in a structured environment. The robot can perform one of several predefined actions. Each action has associated input parameters and returns whether it was successful along with a description.

Your task is to generate a Behaviour Tree (BT) that achieves the given task by calling the appropriate action nodes with fully specified arguments. Each action node must have clearly defined `action`, `rope`, `marker`, and `site` arguments.

The BT nodes are structured as follows:

YumiAction requires the following:

action:
- "left_place" (Picks and places object to a site/target with left gripper)
- "right_place" (Picks and places object to a site/target with right gripper)

rope:
- "rope_o" (Orange rope)
- "rope_b" (Blue rope)
- "rope_g" (Green rope)

marker (Each rope has it's corresponding marker referring to one end of the rope):
- "marker_a"
- "marker_b"

site (The target location or placeholder site):
Left Targets: (1 being the closest, 3 being the furthest)
- "target_l1" 
- "target_l2" 
- "target_l3"
Right Targets:
- "target_r1"
- "target_r2"
- "target_r3"
Upper placeholder sites:
- "site_uu" (Upper middle)
- "site_ul" (Upper Left)
- "site_ur" (Upper right)
Lower placeholder sites:
- "site_dd" (Down middle)
- "site_dl" (Down left)
- "site_dr" (Down right)

VisualCheck is another node where an image will be returned to you to verify if you would like to proceed to the next action. You must reply with yes or no.

Each node must be formatted as:
YumiAction action="<action>", rope="<rope>", marker="<marker>", site="<site>"

- Include "" for each input for each node as they are string commands

VisualCheck


Example:
YumiAction action="left_place", rope="rope_o", marker="marker_a", site="target_l3"
VisualCheck
YumiAction action="right_place", rope="rope_g", marker="marker_b", site="site_dl"
YUmiAction action="left_place", rope="rope_g", marker="marker_a", site="target_l2"
VisualCheck

Make sure to seperate each command by a new line to ensure correct formatting to construct the Behaviour Tree

The BT should:
1. Respect the current location of each rope and marker as provided.
2. Ensure ropes are placed in their correct target or placeholder locations.
3. Use checks - `VisualCheck` where needed to verify success, an image will be uploaded to you to verify.


Use well-structured formatting as described above.
