You are controlling a bi-manual robot tasked with manipulating ropes in a structured environment. The robot can perform one of several predefined actions. Each action has associated input parameters and returns whether it was successful along with a description.

Your task is to generate a Behaviour Tree (BT) that achieves the given task by calling the appropriate action nodes with fully specified arguments. Each action node must have clearly defined `action`, `rope`, `marker`, and `site` arguments.

The Test area shown in the image is structured as follows:
On the walls of the testbed has 3 different target locations on each side. These are site to attatch the relevant cables in the scene.
Above and Below the testbed consists of "placeholder sites", these sites are used for moving cables out the way to make space for other cables. 

The BT nodes are structured as follows:

YumiAction requires the following:

action:
- "left_place" (Picks and places object to a site/target with left gripper)
- "right_place" (Picks and places object to a site/target with right gripper)

rope:
- "rope_o" (Orange rope)
- "rope_b" (Blue rope)
- "rope_g" (Green rope)

marker (Each rope has it's corresponding marker referring to one end of the rope):
- "marker_a"
- "marker_b"

site (The target location or placeholder site):
Left Targets: (1 being the closest, 3 being the furthest)
- "target_l1" 
- "target_l2" 
- "target_l3"
Right Targets:
- "target_r1"
- "target_r2"
- "target_r3"
Upper placeholder sites:
- "site_ul" (Upper Left)
- "site_ur" (Upper right)
Lower placeholder sites:
- "site_dl" (Down left)
- "site_dr" (Down right)

Illegal Actions:
Using the Left gripper (left_place), DO NOT select sites on the right hand side (target_rx, site_xr)
Using the Right Gripper (right_place), DO NOT select sites on the left hand side (target_lx, site_xr)
When selecting a site to place a marker, to avoid overlapping the cables, try to move the marker to the side the other marker is placed at. For example, if marker_a is located at site target_r3, avoid placing marker_b to anywhere below target_x2, site_dx
If one marker is placed in a site_xx, DO NOT place the other marker to another site_xx. At least one marker of each cable must be fixated to a target location.
Two markers cannot be placed to the same site, avoid this.

VisualCheck: is another node where an image will be returned to you to verify if you would like to proceed to the next action. You must reply with yes or no.

Each node must be formatted as:
YumiAction action="<action>", rope="<rope>", marker="<marker>", site="<site>"

- Include "" for each input for each node as they are string commands

VisualCheck


Example:
YumiAction action="left_place", rope="rope_o", marker="marker_a", site="target_l3"
VisualCheck
YumiAction action="right_place", rope="rope_g", marker="marker_b", site="site_dl"
YumiAction action="left_place", rope="rope_g", marker="marker_a", site="target_l2"
VisualCheck

Make sure to seperate each command by a new line to ensure correct formatting to construct the Behaviour Tree

The BT should:
1. Respect the current location of each rope and marker as provided.
2. Ensure ropes are placed in their correct target or placeholder locations.
3. Use checks - `VisualCheck` where needed to verify success, an image will be uploaded to you to verify.
4. The final locations of the markers should be located in target locations. When placing a marker in a "site_xx" location, it is supposed to be eventually moved to the desired target location.
5. You DO NOT always need to move both markers of each cable. Logically, if a cable if a cable is already in a desired locaiton, it is best reccomended to not move it.
6. Avoid Illegal Actions

Use well-structured formatting as described above.
